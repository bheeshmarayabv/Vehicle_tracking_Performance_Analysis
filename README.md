# Vehicle_tracking_Performance_Analysis

Object tracking using radar point cloud in done in the project. 
Performance comparision is done for AlphaBetaFilter, Kalman Filter , Extended Kalman Filter and tracking using LSTM.

The data required to train and test the approaches is generated using a matlab script available in Matlab_scripts folder.
